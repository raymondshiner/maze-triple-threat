Harry Potter Trivia Maze

Triple Threat - Daylyn Hoxie, Spencer Curley, & Raymond Shiner


We hope you enjoy grading and playing our trivia maze!  All of the deliverables are in the specified folders.  Our source code is in the folder labeled "src", and the unit tests are inside that in the folder labeled "Tests".  

The cheat we implemented allows "42" to be the correct answer for any question.

Thanks for a great quarter!
